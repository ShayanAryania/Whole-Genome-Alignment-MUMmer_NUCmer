# Whole-Genome-Amplification_-MUMmer_NUCmer
Whole Genome Amplification (WGA) is a method for robust amplification of an entire genome, starting with nanogram quantities of DNA and resulting in microgram quantities of amplified products.
MUMmer is a bioinformatics software system for sequence alignment. It is based on the suffix tree data structure. It has been used for comparing different genomes assemblies to one another, which allows scientists to determine how a genome has changed. The acronym "MUMmer" comes from "Maximal Unique Matches", or MUMs.
