# Whole-Genome-Alignment-MUMmer_NUCmer
A critical step towards this understanding is whole-genome alignment (WGA), a cornerstone of bioinformatics that aligns entire genomes from different species or individuals within the same species.
MUMmer is a bioinformatics software system for sequence alignment. It is based on the suffix tree data structure. It has been used for comparing different genomes assemblies to one another, which allows scientists to determine how a genome has changed. The acronym "MUMmer" comes from "Maximal Unique Matches", or MUMs.
